"Their customer service has poor quality, their agents are not enough knowledge for the process. "
when I called the company the agents were so rude and didn't listen to my claim and inform me the broker is quit and we are not responsible and nobody can help me.
 The managers will return your calls or emails after 5 days (if they do). You do not feel they care when you are talking to them. I am fed up and I am switching. I will try to convince my friends and relatives to switch too.
Absolutley terrible service from terrible agents.
 Milewise has zero customer service and even the local agents don’t know anything about it. Waited on the phone for 20 mins and never got to speak to anyone!
"The incident has not been looked into so far as I can tell, though it's hard to tell anything because the agent won't return a simple email. I will never use Allstate again."
Agent says there's some discrepancy regarding my rates. It took hours to reach anyone here
They cancelled my account and told me I need to pay double for one month. Called many times to speak with different agents and all were just saying LIES!
I tried Allstate's car insurance and found out I was lied to by my agent Nicholas Colhoun. Since I did not drive much I was told I would save quite a bit if I used their Milewise program.
"I'm very disappointed with Allstate and the way the claims department is currently handling my auto claim. Long hold times, poor communication between myself and the repair shop my car was towed to in August."
Not happy with Allstate! I will definitely be looking for another insurance company! Highly disappointed with their customer service and claims department
"If you get in an accident with an Allstate client and they are at fault you will receive very poor service. Call a lawyer, look out for yourself"
" It's a waste of time and money, I don't recommend Allstate at all."
"I spent hours on the phone on 7 calls, it took three weeks to get the claim settled. Worst auto insurance company ever!"
They are the absolute worst to deal with. They find ridiculous reasons to not pay.
The customer service and the agent in Lyndhurst is attitude is sort of poor service. 
 Be ready for a tiny inflexible settlement offer when you file a claim and don't expect any help from your local agent.
The lady i spoke to at Allstate was the most incompassionate human being that i have ever spoken to and as uncaring about my situation as i could never have imagined a person to be.
Agents have a poor service when ever I called them either goes to voicemail or it keeps ringing then goes to voicemail. 
Avoid this company? Even if you don't file any claims they raise your prices with no explanation. I could go on but I'll keep it short.
 The reps have been very rude. Allstate does not want to settle claims. Good Luck if you decide to get a policy with them.
Horrible Customer Service ( Rude) and if they had zero stars i would have done that.
Do not go with this company they will not pay for any damage on your home their deductible is very very high and what they value it is very low
"Once accident happens, then they drop the coverage and don’t pay to claims. I have suffered a huge depression and homelessness."
 Would never ever recommend Allstate insurance to anyone!! Had water damage and they are not even covering half of the coverage!! It also took them 4 weeks just to get an appraiser out to look at our house!
Absolutely terrible policy from Allstate
Very dissapointed by lack response when an emergency strikes. 
"WORST experience EVER!  Failed to refund, and now they stopped answering and responding."
 Poor customer service. Lowest price but goes up every time you renew
"I would absolutely not recommend this insurance. To this day I am still expecting to hear back from them after sending more than 10 emails, 2 phone calls."
Horrible to file a claim and get your car fix even when you weren’t at fault!
I called three times to let them know my payment would be late and told them the date that I could pay my bill. I will NEVER use Allstate again.
They refused to pay for a rental stated they would reimburse me- the rental required payment in full plus a $200 deposit that had to be payed upfront.
Poor customer service. Lack of communication with me. Then when I cancel they forget to turn it in and I get another bill. Been fighting with them for months.
"Long phone wait time, rude and difficult to understand customer service, poor communication (never got the confirmation text they promised), overcharged on towing when I only needed to get pulled off a curb. Overall, lots of waiting and lots of money for poor service."
Very disappointed with their policy that when you become a surviving spouse your insurance rates go up.
POOR SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES.
They care nothing about the items you lost during a car accident.
I'm very disappointed with Allstate and the way the claims department is currently handling my auto claim.
Difficult to get ahold of anybody when you need assistance & difficult to use roadside assistance
